    <h1>Keep up the hoop</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because
      his little <br />
      brother is better than him<br />
      <br />
      Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes
      round and it <br />
      will return him an encouraging message :)<br />
      <br />
      If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to
      tricks".<br />
      <br />
      If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get
      it".<br />
